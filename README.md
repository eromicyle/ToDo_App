# ToDo_App
A simple command-line To-Do application built in C++.
I created this project out of curiosity and to sharpen my C++ skills.

Key Points:
- Helped me understand and reinforce several core C++ concepts.
- Currently features a basic CLI for managing tasks.
- Future plans include improving the user interface and adding more features.

Stay tuned for updates!
